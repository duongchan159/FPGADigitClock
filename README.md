# FPGADigitClock
# Digital Clock Project
• A digital clock is a common counter application.

– Display is given in hour, minutes, seconds.

– A precise frequency is required.

• Battery operated devices use a crystal oscillator.

• 60 Hz ac power line frequency is also used.

Result:

– Clock.v: For verilogHDL code.

– Clock.vwf: Simulating vector waveform file.

– Clock.png: Result of the clock.
